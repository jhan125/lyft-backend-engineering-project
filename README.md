# lyft-backend-engineering-project

## Project Description
- Completed the Back-End Engineering job simulation, taking over development of an unfinished project for the Lyft Rentals team.

- Drafted a UML class diagram representing a new reorganized architecture.

- Refactored a messy codebase inherited from another team to accurately reflect my new design.

- Implemented unit tests and added new functionality using test-driven development.

## Interview Tip

**“Why are you interested in this role?”**

I recently participated in Lyft’s job simulation on Forage, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to work in a back-end engineering team there.

In the job simulation I was able to take over the development of an unfinished project for the Lyft Rentals team, going through the process of reoganizing the architecture, refactoring the codebase, implementing unit tests and adding functionality.

It was fantastic to see how back-eng engineers work on projects and to understand how they collaborate with product managers, data scientists and various other teams.

Reflecting on my participation, this experience helped me to realize that I’m really passionate about working in a collaborative environment where I get to solve complex problems that impact millions of users.

I would love to apply what I’ve learned during this job simulation in a back-end engineering team at Lyft in the future.
