# Task 2

## Code Refractoring

- Refactoring is the art of reorganizing a codebase without modifying its behavior.
- The main goal of refactoring is to fight technical debt.
- Any code that exists longer than the duration of a school project is fluid - it is a living, changing thing. No codebase is open and shut, there are always bugs to thump and features to add.
- As a codebase grows older, it begins to accumulate code smells. New features are tacked on, dirty fixes are settled for, and technical debt is accrued. All of these things contribute to the overall messiness of the project.
- Did you say smells? Yes, code smells are indicators of problems that can be addressed during refactoring.
- While code smells do not hamper the correctness of a system, they do impair your ability to make changes, and tend to fill programmers with a sense of lingering dread. Eventually, the aroma becomes unbearable, and the decision is made to refactor. Refactoring is cleanliness, and cleanliness is what separates code that lasts from code that doesnâ€™t.

## Goal

The goal of this task is to rewrite the codebase to bring it in line with the new design. So with that in mind, spend some time understanding:

How each class fits together
What is the justification for each design decision
How that new design might be reflected in the existing messy codebase

If any part of the diagram confuses you, read through the resources below:

Pay special attention to the strategy and factory patterns.
